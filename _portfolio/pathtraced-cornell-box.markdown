This project's aim was to simulate a [Cornell box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box). This was achieved by 
pathtracing a scene, and computing the diffuse global illumination, using physics-based material properties.

The whole process in handled by a single GLSL shader, running on [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com). 

Result (warning : GPU intensive) :
