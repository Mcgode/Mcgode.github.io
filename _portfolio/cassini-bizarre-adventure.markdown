While this project started out as a student project for my 3D graphics classes, I used this occasion 
to go beyond the base specifications and went ahead and experimented with custom render effects (like 
rendering shadows for non-opaque textures and animated post-processing), with some tasty inside jokes.

Python was used for this project, as this was one its specifications, along with OpenGL 3.3. The 
use of Python over a more conventional language for this like C++ allowed me to use more high-level 
paradigms and eased the task a bit.

The source code is unavailable due to exam fraud prevention rules.
