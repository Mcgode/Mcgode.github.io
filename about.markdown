Hey there !

Since you got here, it seems that I should introduce myself properly.

So hi! My name is Max Godefroy, and while, according to my diploma, I am a certified engineer in 
information systems and computer science, it hasn't stopped me from focussing mainly on
graphics and engine programming, with a bit of game programming here and there.

I have a keen interest in the game development field, and as a consequence, I often find myself 
checking out new technologies in the industry. As such, you might also find me tinkering with
some of my personal projects, which range from game mechanic prototype to low-level game engine. 
<br>
Also, like many people in the field, I love video games, and I try to sample both the newest and 
some older titles.


### Tidbits

Here you'll find some of my miscellaneous achievements and stuff which I wasn't able to include 
elsewhere.
 - I have contributed in the past to [three.js](https://threejs.org), an open-source WebGL framework
 - I am the proud owner of the cutest kitten you've ever laid your eyes on.
 - The previous point does not prevent me from loving doggos as well.
