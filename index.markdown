<h3 class="page-heading">Hello!</h3>

Welcome to my humble website. I'm Max, a passionate programmer. 
I have professional experience in 3D graphics. 
I also have an interest in engine programming, and you might find me tinkering with my game engine
prototype here and there.

On this website, you will find a little showcase of my works in the form of my portfolio, 
and some articles related to technical topics I've encountered along the way.
